# Person-Fluence-Test-

This code provides several methods for analyzing speech fluency from audio files. It performs different calculations and offers various visualizations to assess speech fluency.

Functionality:
Filled Pause Detection: Identifies occurrences of "uh" and "um" in text, classifying speech as "bad" if present, otherwise "good".
Pitch Variation Analysis: Calculates the mean pitch value and classifies speech fluency based on the ratio of high-pitch to low-pitch intervals.
Pitch Visualization: Plots the pitch variation over time.
Mel Spectrogram Generation: Visualizes the frequency content of the audio signal over time.
Fluency Score Calculation: Assigns a score to each time frame based on spectrogram features (example implementation provided).
Fluent/Disfluent Segment Classification: Segments the audio based on a fluency score threshold (example implementation provided).


Sure, here is a README file that you can use for your fluency analysis code on GitHub:

Fluency Analysis Code
This code provides several methods for analyzing speech fluency from audio files. It performs different calculations and offers various visualizations to assess speech fluency.

Functionality:

Fluency Score Calculation: Assigns a score to each time frame based on spectrogram features (example implementation provided).
Fluent/Disfluent Segment Classification: Segments the audio based on a fluency score threshold (example implementation provided).

Usage:
Replace the file paths in the code with your audio files.
Adjust parameters like FLUENT_THRESHOLD and hop_length if needed.
Run the code to perform the desired analysis.



Future Improvements:
Implement a more sophisticated fluency scoring algorithm based on spectral features.
Integrate speaker-specific models for personalized analysis.
Develop interactive visualizations for exploring fluency patterns.
